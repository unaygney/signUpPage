### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript


### What I learned

I didn't have much trouble doing the html and css side and it was fun to design it.While writing the javascript part, I tried to divide the code into functions as much as possible and tried to write it cleanly.I got the regex part from a thread on stackoverflow.It was a project that I enjoyed while coding.
